# Daily QA Plan with Penta-Guide Phantom

Objective: To perform all components of the full treatment pipeline from simulation CT to delivering a treatment using a phantom with known isocenter displacements and rotation angles. 


## Scan the phantom in the simulation CT


Daily 6DoF CBCT/Couch QA

1. Place the QUASAR™ Penta-Guide Phantom in the Tilt Plate
2.  Align the Tilt Plate markings with the room lasers. The level indicators show that the Tilt Plate is level, but the phantom is not leve
3. Acquire CBCT of the QUASAR™ Penta-Guide Phantom and Tilt Plate 

4. Use the image registration tools to align the CBCT with a reference CT of the QUASAR™ Penta-Guide Phantom (reference CT should not contain Tilt Plate) Ensure the calculated shifts are within 1mm of the expected shifts (magnitude of shifts depends on markings used), and that rotations are <0.5 degrees from expected rotation (0.75º, 1.25º, and 1.0º)
5. Apply the correction and move the couch. Check that the lasers now coincide with the central markings on the QUASAR™ Penta-Guide Phantom. The level indicators show that the phantom is level, but the Tilt Plate is not level.



Information: Tilt angles are: 0.75º, 1.25º, and 1.0º 


Tips for setup:
- Use the localization bar for faster, simpler setup
