Radiation, Image and Mechanical Isocenter Verification (SNC Winston-Lutz cube)

Procedure: IsoCal and IsoVer were performed before the Winston Lutz test to ensure the isocenter position is acceptable. The SNC Winston-Lutz cube was placed on the couch and aligned to the laser isocenter with the arrow on the top surface pointing towards the gantry as pictured below. The gantry and collimator were both set to 0Â° and the light field was used to align the top surface. The patient ZZZTMHDELTA, MONTHLYQA (pmh02272020) was created in Aria with all the gantry, collimator and table settings necessary to take all the portal images. The jaws were set to a 3x3 cm field size and portal images were taken at various gantry, collimator and table angles listed below. The field size was then shaped with the MLC to 3x3 cm (Jaws at 5cm) and images were taken at the cardinal gantry angles. The images were then imported in DoseLab version 6.6 and analyzed with its Winston-Lutz tool. This tool determines the distance between the sphere located at the center of the SNC phantom and the field isocenter. The tolerance for any of the geometries is 1 mm. All DoseLab reports are attached to this document.


We first perform a CBCT to align the cube to the DRR images
We then acquire images at different angles
